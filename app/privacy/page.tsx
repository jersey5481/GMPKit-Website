                  processes, including those related to national security. We may also share information with our legal
                  advisors or auditors to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights, enforce our contracts, or
                  defend against legal claims. Additionally, we may share personal information as necessary to detect,
                  investigate, prevent, or take action against illegal activities, fraud, security threats, or
                  violations of our agreements and policies. To the extent EU/UK data protection law applies, the legal
                  basis for this is compliance with legal obligations or our legitimate interest in meeting other
                  applicable legal requirements.
